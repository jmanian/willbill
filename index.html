  <li>Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Tell%20our%20state%20legislators%20to%20stop%20letting%20big%20corporations%20steal%20our%20tax%20dollars!&amp;url=http://www.willguzzardi.com/loopholes" target="_blank">Tweet it now!</a>): Tell our state legislators to stop letting big corporations steal our tax dollars! http://www.willguzzardi.com/loopholes</li>
  <li>Facebook (<a href="http://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.willguzzardi.com/loopholes" target="_blank">Post it now!</a>): Illinois is in a massive budget crisis. Instead of cutting services to people in need, or raising taxes on everyone, how about closing $1 billion in loopholes that let big corporations game the system? Those dollars belong to us.
